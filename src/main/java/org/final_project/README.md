Team 7 - Card Pack Opener
Project Owner - Junior Weil
Scrum Master - Brandon Cho
Developer - Joseph Helm
Developer - Brian Scotto
    This project allows the user to create their own player card for either soccer basketball or football. They can 
design their own card and give the card their own name, position, and overall rating.  The program also allows the 
user to save their custom-made card to the arraylist of actual player cards of real life professional athletes.  
From there the user can open a pack that randomly generates a card from the list of the selected sport and reveals it 
to the user.
